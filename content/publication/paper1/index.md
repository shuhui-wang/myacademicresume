abstract: Critical source areas (CSAs) are the priority locations for non-point source pollution (NPSP) control, and their spatial distribution is influenced by NPSP influencing factors. Therefore, identifying CSAs and the dominant NPSP influencing factors are important for NPSP research and control, while there is limited discussion in quantifying the nonlinear relationships between factors and the excessive pollutant loads in CSAs. In this study, CSAs were first identified based on the pollutant loads simulated by the AnnAGNPS model in a typical agricultural watershed in Three Gorges Reservoir region, and eight factors associated with the NPSP generation and transport processes were selected as the NPSP influencing factors. The boosted regression tree model was applied to quantify the contribution rate of each factor and the partial dependence plots were developed to visualize the non-linear relationships and the thresholds between factors and TN/TP loads in CSAs. Results revealed that land use has the largest contribution rate (37.35%) on TN-CSAs, followed by nitrogenous fertilizer (36.93%), and soil type (17.59%), while for TP-CSAs, phosphorus fertilizer (57.83%) ranked first in contribution rate, followed by land use type (25.03%) and soil type (13.70%). The sloping farmland and orchards, as well as certain soil types are positively correlated with CSAs, and TN/TP loads respond positively with increasing factor values before thresholds. In addition, the preliminary step of BMPs (Best Management Practices) planning was conducted based on the study results to select suitable BMPs with high ecological effectiveness. In general, this study identified the dominant NPSP influencing factor on CSAs, as well as the non-linear relationships and thresholds associated with the pollutant loads trends that managers should be aware of, which contribute to an in-depth understanding of NPSP mechanism and provide insights for NPSP control.
