abstract: Best management practices (BMPs) are being implemented to reduce non-point sources of pollution in China and worldwide, and the The effectiveness of individual BMPs is usually assessed through controlled experiments. Field evaluation of the effectiveness of a great majority of BMPs is limited by cost of implementation, site-specific response, and length of time needed to document reliable response. Non-point source pollution (NPS) models are increasingly relied upon to estimate water quality response to BMP implementation. This study has developed and tested a tool for estimating the effectiveness of BMPs in controlling NPS pollution by collecting and analyzing existing data from previous studies. It includes 60 BMPs grouped into six classes. Data from combined soil and slope analyses were used to design a BMP effectiveness estimator driven by hydrologic soil groups and slope classes using Visual Basic for Applications and Structured Query Language. This BMPs selection system was tested and validated for BMPs selection in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area. Results demonstrate that the tool can be served as an efficient and easy tool for identifying potentially useful BMPs in agricultural areas in China. Overall, this will also allow water environmental professionals to make more confident and accurate BMP recommendations and manage watersheds more effectively.
