abstract: Best management practices (BMPs) are being implemented to reduce non-point sources of pollution in China and worldwide, and the effectiveness of BMPs is usually assessed through controlled experiments. This study has developed a BMPs selection system for estimating the ecological effectiveness of BMPs in controlling NPS pollution by collecting and analyzing existing data from previous studies in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region (TGRR). In addition, the construction and maintenance method and cost for each BMPs scenario was described and calculated as well. This system includes more than 300 BMPs scenarios, where decision makers can select appropriate BMPs scenarios according to ecological goals, characteristics of application areas, as well as the BMPs technical features. This system can be served as an efficient and easy tool for identifying potentially useful BMPs in agricultural areas in TGRR and beneficial to watershed planning.
