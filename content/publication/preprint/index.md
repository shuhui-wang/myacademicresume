abstract: The purpose of the present invention is to provide a construction method for a vegetation buffer with optimized water flow path, which is beneficial for runoff velocity and surface scouring reduction. Specifically, the removal of agricultural surface pollutants by plants is enhanced by constructing small recessed ecological filter ponds to increase the residence time of water in the buffer.
