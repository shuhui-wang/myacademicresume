abstract: Agricultural Non-point source pollution (NPSP) is considered as a major contributor to water quality impairment worldwide, and fortunately, best management practices (BMPs) can effectively reduce their generation and migration to receiving water bodies. In general, BMPs planning within a watershed needs to satisfy conflicting objectives simultaneously, including obtaining the maximum pollution reduction possibility and minimum cost, making it a multi-objective problem (MOP). Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have proven their efficiency in solving real-world MOPs, and NSGA-II is one of the most widely used MOEAs which is usually applied in combination with hydrological or NPSP models to search for optimal BMPs planning. However, some newly proposed MOEAs have been shown to be effective in solving three-objective optimization problems, and they can find higher-quality solutions for MOPs. By combining with the BMPs database developed by the NPSP model AnnAGNPS for a typical agricultural watershed in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region (TGRR), this study compared the performance of three state-of-the-art MOEAs (domination-based NSGA-II, decomposition-based MOEA/D and domination-decomposition combined NSGA-III) to find the optimal MOEA for the three-objective BMPs planning problem. The result shows that NSGA-II outperformed other MOEAs in terms of the scalability and uniform distribution of its solutions set, and its solutions were further classified into different cost categories to suit decision makersâ€™ preferences. This study provides guidance for decision makers in choosing appropriate MOEAs and optimal control parameter settings for BMPs planning problem, and the solutions with optimal ecological-economical effectiveness can be extended to similar watersheds in the TGRR to control agricultural NPSP.
