abstract: Simulation-based optimization (S-O) frameworks are effective in developing cost-effective watershed management strategies, where the selection of optimization algorithm and parameter settings greatly influence the quality of strategies. Despite the development and improvement of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) provide more alternatives for optimization and improve the efficiency in finding robust solutions, they typically have limited applications in real-world decision contexts. In this study, we compared and quantified the performance of NSGA-II, MOEA/D and NSGA-III in a real-world watershed management problem with the objectives of minimizing TN and TP losses at minimal cost, and the searching behavior of MOEAs under different parameter settings was evaluated quantitatively. Results show that higher crossover or mutation probabilities do not necessarily promote convergence and diversity in the solution set, while a larger generation and population size will assist in finding high-quality solutions. Furthermore, statistical results show that NSGA-II is advantageous in finding the solution set with good convergence and diversity while providing more decision options at the same computational cost, and the average cost of the NSGA-II optimized strategies is 32.22% (47.83%) of the commonly used targeting strategies to achieve the same TN (TP) reduction target. In addition, this study also discussed the development of resilient watershed management to buffer the impacts of climate change on aquatic system, the incorporation of fuzzy programming in the S-O framework to develop robust watershed management strategies under uncertainty, and the application of machine learning-based surrogate modeling to reduce the high computational cost in the S-O framework. These results can contribute to the understanding of MOEAs and provide guidance to decision makers to reach practical and cost-effective watershed management strategies.
