        Developing watershed management strategies to reduce non-point source pollution
        * Conceptualized the research and developed the theoretical framework
        * Designed 60 Best Management Practice (BMP) scenarios and developed a database for watershed management
        * Developed a simulation-based optimization framework to search cost-effective watershed management strategies and compared the performance of several advanced MOEAs applied to a real-world muli-objective optimization problem. The average cost of optimized strategies is 32.22% or 47.83% of the commonly used strategies
        * Delivered a presentation on non-point source pollution studies and watershed management to international graduate students (2022-5-16)
        * First-authored the research manuscript, which was published
       
        
        Assessment of influencing factors on non-point source pollution critical source areas
        * Conceptualized the research and developed the theoretical framework
        * Collected spatial and attribute data of the study watershed (runoff, soil property, land use and meteorological data, etc.), applied a semi-distributed model (AnnAGNPS) to identify the critical source areas
        * Applied machine learning technique to identify the dominant influencing factors of critical source areas, explored the non-linear relationships and potential thresholds that may cause great changes in pollution losses
        * Filtered a set of suitable BMPs to reduce non-point source pollution for decision makers
        * First-authored the research manuscript, which was published
        
        Research on quantifying the effectiveness of vegetated buffer stripes
        * Assembled experiment apparatus, cultivated vegetation and collected water samples in the field experiments, measured water quality in the laboratory
        * Quantified the reduction rate of vegetated buffers on sediment, total nitrogen and total phosphorus, identified the optimal width of stripe and vegetation type for non-point source pollution reduction in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region
        * Co-authored the research manuscript, which was published
        * Co-designed a technique for constructing vegetated buffer stripes in sloping areas, which was published as a patent
        
        Analysis of runoff and sediment variations in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region
        * Conceptualized the research and developed the theoretical framework
        * Analyzed long-term (2002-2017) runoff and sediment loads changes in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region using Mann-Kendall test and Double Cumulative Curve
        * Quantified the impact of human activity and climate change on runoff and sediment
        * First-authored the research manuscript, which was published
