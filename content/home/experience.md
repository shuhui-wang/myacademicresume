  - title: Full-time Student Researcher
    company: National Key R&D Program of China (Best Management Practices for Non-point Source Pollution Control in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region (2017YFC0505303))

        Watershed Planning for Non-point Source Pollution Control
        * Designed 60 Best Management Practice (BMPs) scenarios for non-point source pollution control, and developed a BMPs database comprising the ecological effectiveness and costs
        * Built multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (NSGA-II, NSGA-III, MOEA/D) to find the optimal watershed planning and compared the performance of three algorithms in multi-objectives watershed planning problem. The average cost of proposed watershed planning is nearly 50% that of unoptimized planning for the same ecological objective
        * Authored the research manuscript, which has been submitted to the journal (under review)
        * Delivered presentations on the comprehensive strategy on non-point source pollution research and control system to graduate students
        
        Assessment of influencing factors on non-point source pollution critical source areas
        * Collected spatial and attribute data (runoff, soil property, land use, meteorological, etc.), develop a semi-distributed model (AnnAGNPS) for the study watershed and identified the critical source areas of non-point source pollution
        * Applied machine learning method (Boosted Regression Tree Model) to identify the dominant influencing factors on critical source areas as well as the non-linear relationships and thresholds associated with the non-point pollution loads variations that watershed managers should be aware of
        * Adopted clustering analysis for critical source areas further classification and proposed suitable BMPs scenarios for decision makers
        * Authored the research manuscript, which has been submitted to the journal (under review)
