  - title: Full-time Student Researcher
    company: National Key R&D Program of China (Best Management Practices for Non-point Source Pollution Control in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region (2017YFC0505303))
    company_url: ''
    location: Beijing, Chongqing, Hubei
    date_start: '2018-11-01'
    date_end: '2022-04-30'

        Developing watershed management strategies to reduce non-point source pollution
        * Developed 60 Best Management Practice (BMP) scenarios and a database on their effectiveness and costs
        * Developed a simulation-based optimization framework to search the cost-effective watershed management strategies, compared the performance of several advanced MOEAs in the framework. The optimized strategies have a significantly lower cost per unit of pollutant reduction than the commonly used targeting strategies.
        * Delivered a presentation on non-point source pollution and watershed management to international graduate students (2022-5-16)
        * First-authored the research manuscript, which has been revised and submitted to the journal
       
        
        Assessment of influencing factors on non-point source pollution critical source areas
        * Collected spatial and attribute data of the study watershed (runoff, soil property, land use and meteorological data, etc.), applied a semi-distributed model (AnnAGNPS) to identify the critical source areas
        * Applied statistical machine learning technique to identify the dominant influencing factors of critical source areas, explored the non-linear relationships and potential that may cause great changes in pollution losses that watershed managers should be aware of
        * Filtered a set of suitable BMPs to reduce non-point source pollution for decision makers
        * First-authored the research manuscript, which has been published
        
        Experimental Research on the Effectiveness of Vegetated Buffer Stripes
         * Assembled experiment apparatus, cultivated vegetation and collected water samples in the field experiments, measured water quality in the laboratory
        * Quantified the reduction rate of vegetated buffers on sediment, total nitrogen and total phosphorus, identified the optimal width of stripe and vegetation type for non-point source pollution reduction in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region
        * Co-authored the research manuscript, which has been published
        * Co-designed a construction method for constructing vegetated buffer stripes in sloping areas, which has been published as a patent
        
        Analysis of Runoff and Sediment variations in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region
        *  Analyzed long-term (2002-2017) runoff and sediment loads for the Yangtze River in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region using Mann-Kendall test and Double Cumulative Curve
        * Quantified the impact of human activity and climate change on runoff and sediment, which further validated the ecological impact of the Three Gorges Dam
        * First-authored the research manuscript, which has been published
