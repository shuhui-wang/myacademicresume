Hi! Shuhui (Alex) here. Thank you for visiting my website!

I am a M.S. Candidate in Soil and Water Conservation and Desertification Combating based at Beijing Forestry University (expected graduation: June 2022), advised by Prof. Yujie Wang and Yunqi Wang. Most of my work involves developing models and applying statistical techniques to solve watershed planning problems.

My current research explore the nonlinear relationships between influencing factors and non-point source pollution loads by machine learning methods (Random Forest, etc.), as well as aims to find the optimal watershed planning with minimum cost and pollution loads by MOEAs.
