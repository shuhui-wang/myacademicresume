Hi! Shuhui (Alex) here. Thank you for visiting my website!

I am a M.S. Candidate in Soil and Water Conservation and Desertification Combating based at Beijing Forestry University (expected graduation: June 2022), advised by Prof. Yujie Wang and Yunqi Wang. Most of my work involves developing models and applying statistical methodology and computational tools to solve problems in watershed planning.

My current research and writing explore the nonlinear relationships between influencing factors and non-point source pollution loads, as well as aims to find the optimal watershed planning with minimum cost and pollution loads.
