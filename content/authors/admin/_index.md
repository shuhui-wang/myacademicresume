Hi! Shuhui (Jesse) here. Thank you for visiting my website!

I am a graduate student in Soil and water conservation engineering at Beijing Forestry University under the supervision of Prof. Yujie Wang and Prof. Yunqi Wang. Most of my work involves developing models and statistical techniques for solving problems in non-point source pollution control and watershed management.

My current study explored the non-point source pollution characteristics through statistical machine learning methods (Regression Tree, Clustering, etc.) and investigated the non-linear relationships and potential thresholds that watershed managers should be aware of. In addition, cost-effective watershed management strategies were explored through a simulation-based optimization framework, where the performance of several advanced MOEAs was compared.

Prior to being qualified as a graduate student, my study focused on investigating the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of runoff and sediment load in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region, China.
