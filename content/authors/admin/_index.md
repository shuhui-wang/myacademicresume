Hi! Shuhui (Alex) here. Thank you for visiting my website!

I am a graduate student in Soil and water conservation engineering at Beijing Forestry University (expected graduation: June 2022) under the supervision of Prof. Yujie Wang and Prof. Yunqi Wang. Most of my work involves developing models and statistical techniques for solving problems in the non-point source pollution control and watershed planning.

My current study explores nonlinear relationships between influencing factors and non-point source pollution loads through machine learning methods (Random Forest, Clustering, etc.) and search the thresholds of influencing factors that watershed managers should be aware of. In addition, I also study on watershed planning problem by several state-to-art multiobjecitve evolutionary algorithms (NSGA-II, NSGA-III, MOEA/D).

Prior to being qualified as a graduate student, my study emphasized on investigating the spatial and temporal heterogeneity and driving factors of runoff and sediment load variations in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region, China.
